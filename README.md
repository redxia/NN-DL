EECE C247 Neural Networks and Deep Learning

In The final Project, I managed a group of 3 to research how well Long Term Short Term Memory (Recurrent Neural Network RNN) model in deep learning can predict the S & P 500 from 06/01/09 - 12/31/2018. This is because of I would like to investigate post-financial crisis. The researched ended on Dec 2019 because I only have access to CRISP data until then. Overall, LSTM turned out to be a very good predictor, beating the traditional convolution neural network and the classical linear regression. The linear regression provided a standard error of 98.54 in our test set, however, our RNN model provided an RMSE 15.36, outperforming by a large margin. You may find the codes we used in the folder.
